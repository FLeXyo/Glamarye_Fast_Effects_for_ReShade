Screenshots were made outside the bank in Beauclair, morning, 1080p, graphic settings ultra. Menu is open to pause the game.

Actually, I mostly tested the algorithm how I usually play, at 1440p with custom settings between high and medium, but comparison of algorithms should be easier with these settings.
